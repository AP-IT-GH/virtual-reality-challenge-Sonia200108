Challenge: Challenge 2 - 3D Painting

De taken dat ik deze challenge heb gedaan:

1.  The Canvas that allows you to change the shape on the pedestal follows the camera.
    This canvas should be stationary next to the pedestal.

2.  The toggled ray and palette canvas are tracking the opposite hands.
    The palette should move with the left hand and, when you press the thumbstick or primary button on the right controller, the toggled ray should emit from the right hand.

3.  The paint brush activation is backwards, starting when the trigger is released and stopping when itâ€™s pressed.
    The paintbrush should create a trail while the trigger is being held, stopping when the trigger is released.

4.  The medium brush size button turns invisible when pressed and makes the trail gigantic.
    The button should turn the same grey color as the other buttons when pressed and change the trail to a size in between the small and large brush sizes.

5.  The paint brush sound effect stays the same, regardless of how far it is from you.
    The paint brush sound should be at full volume close to your face, but about 50% volume when your arm is outstretched
